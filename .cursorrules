Create a design system inspired by vintage terminal interfaces and modern brutalist web design. Use a stark monochromatic color palette limited to pure black backgrounds (#000000) with white and gray elements for content. The interface should feel technical and precise, with crisp edges and intentional spacing.
Key characteristics:

Monospace typography throughout
Sharp contrast between elements
Minimal decorative elements
Grid-based layouts with clear visual hierarchy
Terminal-style interface elements
Subtle interactive states
Mechanical movements and transitions
Text-focused design approach

The design should embrace empty space and use typography as a primary design element. Interface elements should have a raw, unpolished quality while maintaining professional functionality. Animation and interaction should feel deliberate and mechanical rather than smooth or organic.
Color palette strictly limited to:

Pure black background
Bright white for primary content
2-3 shades of gray for secondary elements
No additional colors except for absolutely critical UI feedback"
